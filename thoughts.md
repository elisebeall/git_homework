I am feeling relieved that I am motivated and getting the work done without procrastinating.
I am excited to get to know some of the other people in class!  Christian and I were in the same breakout group for both classes.

I am committed to working on my sleep schedule so I can get work done during the day.  I don't want to be struggling with sleep once Mod 1 starts.
I am committed to using outside sources to practice the concepts that we are learning.

Shoutout to my son Aiden, who is excited that I am going back to school.  Again.
